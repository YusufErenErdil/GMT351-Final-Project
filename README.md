## DESCRİPTİON
  Our pupose in this project is to provide convenience to construction companies in determining the location, which is one of the first stages of the projects. For this, we want to create a database and record the data of the cities such as soil structure, slope, fault line, etc. and use this database to find the best location for the project when starting a project.When information such as the area to be covered by the project, the materials to be used, the rate of resistance to natural disasters such as earthquakes are entered into this database, we aim to directly determine the most suitable location for the project.
